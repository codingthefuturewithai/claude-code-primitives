# Problem Statement Template

Reference template for the pm/discover skill. Quality criteria are embedded in each section.

---

## 1. Problem / Opportunity

**What to capture:** A clear statement of the problem or opportunity. NOT a solution.

**Quality check:**
- States the problem, not a proposed solution
- Specific enough to evaluate (not "make things better")
- Grounded in evidence — user pain, data, client request, or observation

**Example:** "Users can't find documents they ingested last week because search only matches exact keywords, not semantic meaning."

---

## 2. Who Is Affected

**What to capture:** Who experiences this problem? Who benefits from solving it?

**Quality check:**
- Identifies specific user types, not "everyone"
- Describes the impact on each group
- Differentiates between primary and secondary beneficiaries

---

## 3. Why It Matters

**What to capture:** Business impact, user impact, or technical impact. Why invest in solving this?

**Quality check:**
- Quantifiable where possible (time lost, revenue impact, user churn)
- Clear connection between the problem and the impact
- Honest about scale — don't inflate

---

## 4. Prior Art & Existing Capabilities

**What to capture:** What already exists? Has this been tried before? What can we learn?

**Quality check:**
- Searched all available systems (docs, issues, codebase)
- Past attempts documented with outcomes and lessons
- Existing capabilities that overlap identified
- If nothing found, state that explicitly

---

## 5. Scope Boundaries

**What to capture:** What is IN scope? What is explicitly OUT?

**Quality check:**
- "In scope" is specific enough to estimate effort
- "Out of scope" prevents creep — things people might assume are included
- Scope matches the team's capacity and timeline
- Dependencies on other work identified

---

## 6. Open Questions & Risks

**What to capture:** What don't we know yet? What could go wrong?

**Quality check:**
- Questions are specific, not vague
- Each question identifies who might have the answer
- Risks have a sense of impact (not just "this might not work")

---

## 7. Review Status

**What to capture:** Has this been reviewed by the people who will fund or prioritize the work?

**Quality check:**
- Reviewer(s) identified
- Reviewed or review planned
- Decision to proceed / not proceed / needs more work

---

## Overall Quality Criteria

A complete problem statement:
- Clearly states the problem or opportunity (not the solution)
- Identifies who is affected and how
- Explains why it matters (business, user, or technical impact)
- Has clear scope boundaries (in/out)
- References prior related work if any exists
- Has been reviewed by decision-makers
